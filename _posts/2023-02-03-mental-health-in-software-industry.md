excerpt: If you’ve ever been on a job hunt in the software industry, you’ve likely seen a company list “work-life balance” as a benefit. The fact that companies need to tell prospective employees that they’ll allow them to “have a life” is telling, but often missed in this discussion of balance, is mental health.

If you’ve ever been on a job hunt in the software industry, you’ve likely seen a company list “work-life balance” as a benefit. The fact that companies need to tell prospective employees that they’ll allow them to “have a life” is telling, but often missed in this discussion of balance, is mental health.  

On his personal blog, Senior Software Development Engineer, Shane Parker, describes his journey to realization that the high stress of software development led to mental health issues that needed treatment. He highlights some of the common stressors that many people in software experience (and may not even know are stressors) and some of the changes he incorporated in his life to help improve his mental well-being. 

We commend Shane for having the courage to share such a personal and important topic. His story serves as a reminder that mental health should be a priority for everyone in the software industry. If you're struggling with stress or mental health issues, know that help is available and it's important to seek support.
