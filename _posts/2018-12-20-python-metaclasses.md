*Note: All code in this post is assumed to be for Python 3. There are subtle differences in the way classes are handled between Python 2 and 3 (see [here](https://www.python.org/doc/newstyle/)).*

Have you ever heard of _metaclasses_ in Python? I hadn't until recently, and I had been using them for months without
actually knowing how they work. Python's metaclass functionality is one of those language features you'll probably never
need to know about, much less mess with, but it offers some keen insight into Python's OOP model, and is actually quite powerful.

I discovered metaclasses after encountering a pretty common problem. One of our repos contains a class that pulls a bunch of data
over the network, and generally takes a pretty long time to run. As it turned out, we didn't want to spend all this time gathering data
every time we ran the service, so we decided to create a dummy class that we could swap in for the real one. In order for everything
to continue working, both classes needed to expose identical looking functions. Instead of relying on Python's [duck typing](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/duck_typing.shtml), this sounded
like a great place to define an interface that both classes could inherit from, to ensure the callers that nothing would break regardless of
which class was being used. Unfortunately, Python doesn't _have_ interfaces, or at least, not quite built into the language.

Enter Python's [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html), or, cutely, _ABC_. Functionally, abstract base classes
let you define a class with _abstract methods_, which all subclasses _must_ implement in order to be initialized. ABCs are extremely simple
to use, and do exactly what they say on the tin. Here's how you might solve a simplified version of the problem from above using ABCs in Python 3.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class NetworkInterface(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def transfer(self):
        pass


class RealNetwork(NetworkInterface):

    def connect(self):
        # connect to something for real
        return

    def transfer(self):
        # transfer a bunch of data
        return


class FakeNetwork(NetworkInterface):

    def connect(self):
        # don't actually connect to anything!
        return

    def transfer(self):
        # don't transfer anything!
        return
```

Our actual abstract base class that defines the interface our classes inherit from is `NetworkInterface`, which itself inherits from `ABC`. `abstractmethod` is just a [decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) which marks methods as, well, abstract -- subclasses have to implement them. This is all fine, but what has this really gotten us? Let's get rid of `transfer` from `FakeNetwork` and find out.

```python
...
class FakeNetwork(NetworkInterface):

    def connect(self):
        # don't actually connect to anything!
        return

tmp = FakeNetwork()
```

Whoops! We get an error: `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class FakeNetwork with abstract methods transfer` -- that's the abstract base class enforcing the interface. As long as `FakeNetwork` is missing `transfer`, we can't create an instance of it. Neat.

This worked well for our use case, but I was left a bit dissatisfied. How does it all work? In reality, all the magic is happening through the use of metaclasses, but Python sneakily hides that from us by having us inherit from `ABC`, just a normal class inheritence. `ABC` however, is actually a totally empty class! All it does is set its _metaclass_ to be `ABCMeta`, which is where all the work gets done.

### Metaclasses

So what's the deal with this metaclass stuff? As you may have heard, everything in Python is an object. Really, _everything_. Say we have the following

```python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 10

bar = Foo()
```

All objects have types, and since everything is an object, everything has a type. If we call `type(bar)`, we see that `bar` has type `Foo`, as we might expect. What about `type(Foo)` then? We get `type`! The type of the class `Foo` itself (as opposed to an _instance_ of `Foo`) is `type`. `type` is our first real example of a metaclass. All classes in Python 3 are instances of the metaclass `type`. In the same way that you call a class to initialize an object, you call a _metaclass_ to initialize a class. Typically, this means that when the interpreter sees a class definition, it calls `type` to create the class, allowing us to call it to create instances later on.

This means that `type` can do more than just tell us the type of stuff. When called with the correct arguments, `type` can be used to programmatically _create classes_. Observe.

```python
def init(self):
    self.x = 10

Foo = type('Foo', (object,), {'__init__': init})
a = Foo()
a.x # returns 10
```

The first argument to `type` is the desired name of the created class, followed by a list of classes to inherit from. The last argument defines the namespace of the class, or what will become its `__dict__` attribute -- this is the place to define methods, etc. Used this way, 'type' lets us define classes dynamically. Understanding how `type` works under the hood is important in understanding how class definition works, and how we can customize and extend this process.

Recall that all Python classes are instances of `type`. In the first `Foo` example above, when the interpreter sees the `Foo` class definition, it creates a `type` object named `Foo` in the enclosing namespace. To do this, it calls `type.__new__` (just as `__new__` is called for regular old classes) which creates and returns the `type` object named `Foo`. The interpreter then calls `type.__init__`, using the `type` instance returned from `type.__new__` as the first argument ("`self`"). This is the typical way class instances are created as well (e.g., `x = Foo()`). The difference here is that the `__new__` and `__init__` methods of the metaclass are executed before we ever create an instance of the class itself, and can be used to augment or otherwise change the behavior of the overall class. While we can't modify the behavior of `type` directly, by subclassing `type`, we can override the `__new__` and `__init__` methods to define custom behavior.

### Writing our own ABC
This all may be a bit hard to grok, but it should hopefully become clearer when made more concrete. Let's see if we can put this to use by trying to implement a basic version of abstract base classes ourselves, using metaclasses. Metaclasses are the perfect way to solve this problem, since they allow us to run code at the time of class definition. This lets us potentially raise an error if the class definition is incorrect, before we ever get the chance to create an instance of the class. I tend to think of this as somewhat similar to static checking in compiled languages.

For this example, let's just focus on forcing classes to implement any methods marked as "abstract" in the class hierarchy. Our version of an interface will be a bit stronger than Python's ABC, in that it won't allow us to even _define_ a class that fails to implement all necessary methods, let alone _initialize_ an instance of one.  Using our `NetworkInterface` example from earlier, let's first figure out a way to mark methods as "abstract". Decorators are a cheap way to do this:

```python
def abstractfunc(func):
    func.__isabstract__ = True
    return func
```

With our decorator in place, let's fill in some boilerplate. We'll want to define a custom metaclass, with dummy methods `__init__` and `__new__`, and have our desired abstract base class inherit from it. Note that the name `Interface` for our metaclass below has nothing to do with the "Interface" in our `NetworkInterface` class -- we could've named `Interface` anything we want.

```python
class Interface(type):

    def __init__(self, name, bases, namespace):
        pass

    def __new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace):
        pass


class NetworkInterface(metaclass=Interface):

    @abstractfunc
    def connect(self):
        pass

    @abstractfunc
    def transfer(self):
        pass
```

Now, on class definition, both `NetworkInterface` and anything that inherits it will run `Interface.__new__` and `Interface.__init__`. For any class with metaclass `Interface`, we want Python to raise an exception if the class doesn't implement all methods marked as abstract in its parent classes. For bookkeeping purposes, let's augment every class that inherits from `Interface` with two attributes: a list of all its methods, and a list of just its abstract methods. We can do this in `__new__`, by augmenting the class namespace before the class is even created.

```python
class Interface(type):

    def __init__(self, name, bases, namespace):
        pass

    def __new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace):
        namespace['abstract_methods'] = Interface._get_abstract_methods(namespace)
        namespace['all_methods'] = Interface._get_all_methods(namespace)
        cls = super().__new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace)
        return cls

    def _get_abstract_methods(namespace):
        return [name for name, val in namespace.items() if callable(val) and getattr(val, '__isabstract__', False)]

    def _get_all_methods(namespace):
        return [name for name, val in namespace.items() if callable(val)]
```

Our two helper methods just iterate over the objects in the class' namespace and append the object names to a list if the appropriate conditions apply. We add these lists to the class' namespace in `__new__`, which we can then refer to in `__init__` later on. Since `Interface.__new__` is called for any class that inherits from `Interface`, we're guaranteed that all such classes will have the `abstract_methods` and `all_methods` attributes. This means that in `Interface.__init__`, we can iterate over all the abstract methods of the parent class, and make sure that a method with the same name exists in the list of all methods for the _current_ class, the one that's currently being initialized. If we _don't_ find a method in the class with the same name as an abstract method from the parent, we raise an exception. This easily extends to cases of multiple inheritance, by repeating this process for each base class present in `bases`. Putting everything together, we end up with something like this:

```python
def abstractfunc(func):
    func.__isabstract__ = True
    return func

class Interface(type):

    def __init__(self, name, bases, namespace):
        for base in bases:
            must_implement = getattr(base, 'abstract_methods', [])
            class_methods = getattr(self, 'all_methods', [])
            for method in must_implement:
                if method not in class_methods:
                    err_str = """Can't create abstract class {name}!
                    {name} must implement abstract method {method} of class {base_class}!""".format(name=name,
                        method=method,
                        base_class=base.__name__)
                    raise TypeError(err_str)

    def __new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace):
        namespace['abstract_methods'] = Interface._get_abstract_methods(namespace)
        namespace['all_methods'] = Interface._get_all_methods(namespace)
        cls = super().__new__(metaclass, name, bases, namespace)
        return cls

    def _get_abstract_methods(namespace):
        return [name for name, val in namespace.items() if callable(val) and getattr(val, '__isabstract__', False)]

    def _get_all_methods(namespace):
        return [name for name, val in namespace.items() if callable(val)]


class NetworkInterface(metaclass=Interface):

    @abstractfunc
    def connect(self):
        pass

    @abstractfunc
    def transfer(self):
        pass
```

And that should do it! Now, let's see what happens when we try to subclass `NetworkInterface`.

```python
class RealNetwork(NetworkInterface):

    def connect(self):
        pass

    def transfer(self):
        pass
```

Absolutely nothing! Just as we should expect. Since `RealNetwork` implements all the abstract methods of its parent(s), the class gets defined without a hitch. What's probably more important to us however, is when our class _doesn't_ adhere to the contract of the base class.

```python
class FakeNetwork(NetworkInterface):

    def connect_to_server(self):
        pass

    def transfer(self):
        pass
```

Uh oh -- `TypeError: Can't create abstract class FakeNetwork! FakeNetwork must implement abstract method connect of class NetworkInterface!`. In this case, the exception is a good thing. Since `FakeNetwork` doesn't actually implement a method named `connect`, an exception is raised before we ever get the chance to create an instance of the class.

Ultimately, this is a pretty brittle and toy-like implementation of abstract base classes, but hopefully it serves as a good example of how Python metaclasses can be uniquely used to solve problems. Metaclasses are definitely one of the more obscure language features of Python, and often misunderstood. To be fair, there aren't a lot of situations where a problem is most easily or appropriately solvable by using custom metaclasses, but there are occasionally times, like with abstract classes, where the merit of using metaclasses presents itself. If you weren't already familiar with metaclasses, however, hopefully you now have another tool at your disposal when tackling particularly tricky problems in Python.
