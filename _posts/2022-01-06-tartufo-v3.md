As I've [written about previously][tartufo-post], [tartufo] is a tool vital to
our organization. It helps us to ensure that our source code is clear of all
forms of credentials, secrets, keys, and things we just generally don't want to
see potentially getting exposed. It is just one small, yet absolutely vital, link
in our security toolchain. So it is with this in mind that I am now pleased to
announce the release of tartufo v3.0!

## Previously, in tartufo 2.0

With our previous major version bump, v2.0, the goal was to improve the
developer experience. The project from which we originated our work, [truffleHog],
was and still is, an amazingly powerful tool. But it left some things to be
desired from a developer perspective. So we set to work to improve this: we
split the code into distinct modules, separating the CLI from the API; we moved
the code into a hierarchy of classes to enable future growth; we moved the
different "modes" of operation into sub-commands to further de-clutter the
codebase. But all of this work did little to help out those who matter
most: the users of this tool.

## Fast Forward to Today

So, with that in mind, our major focus in v3.0 has been to vastly improve the
user experience! We have taken countless bits of feedback from our users around
what they liked, what they didn't like, what was great, what was just flat
broken, and we've done our best to improve on as many of those things as
possible. Our goal with this new major release is to take a tool that can oftentimes
be frustrating and confusing for a user, into a tool that developers truly
don't mind, and in fact want to have as part of their toolchain! To escape the
shackles of the classic security conundrum, where the tools are often so
cumbersome and difficult to use that developers would rather forego them, despite
the cost.

Many developer hours have gone into this new release, and it would not be
possible without all of the fine contributors both from GoDaddy engineers, as
well as a number of new external contributors! I would like, however, to give a
very special shout-out to our very own [Jeremiah Gowdy][jeremiah]. His initial
work on porting the backend of tartufo to use pygit2 paved the way for much of
the speed gains in this release, and without his efforts, this certainly would
not have happened in the time frame that it did. Thank you, Jeremiah!

And that brings us to the big question: What's so great about this new version?

## The New Hotness

Here is a summary of the big-ticket items we've added, fixed, or improved for
this new major release.

### Performance

* First and foremost, as mentioned before, the backend switched from `GitPython`
  to `pygit2`. This means that, in this background, we are no longer just
  running `git` commands and interpreting the output. We are now actually
  interacting directly with GitDB! This provides us *massive* speedups, as
  well as makes it easier for us to disregard user-config. This means that
  git operations are now performed in the manner that `tartufo` intends them,
  regardless of the user's own git config.

  * Initial work by [Jeremiah Gowdy][jeremiah] — [#122]
  * Conclusion of the transition by [Sushant Mimani][sushant] — [#233]
  * Further polishing to ensure parity of findings with v2.x by
    [Esha Mayuri][esha] — [#249]

* [Scott Bailey][scott] put in extensive work to allow issues to be displayed
  immediately as they are found, as opposed to buffering them for display in one
  big batch at the end. While this may not increase the overall runtime of a
  scan, it will eliminate the "...is it actually doing anything?" aspect of long
  runs — [#227]

### Configuration Changes

* A number of our configuration options have made a transition from contrived /
  specially constructed strings, to a wonder of the [TOML] format: an
  [array of tables]. This has enabled more verbose and readable configuration,
  but has also removed them as command-line options, forcing them to be used
  only in the context of the configuration file. These include:
  * The `--rules` configuration option has changed. This was our final remaining
    piece of configuration that still referred to an external file. Now, this has
    changed to `--rule-patterns`, which are patterns stored directly in your
    configuration file, alongside all the rest of your config. This work was done
    by [Joey Wilhelm][joey] (that's me!) — [#287]
  * The "old" style of configuring `exclude-entropy-patterns` has been removed.
    [Sushant Mimani][sushant] did the work to make this new style the one and only
    way of configuring these. — [#282]
  * One of our most requested features has been "exclusion reasons". Our users
    have found that they end up with an extensive list of `excluded-signatures`,
    and have a hard time knowing what each represents. Thanks to
    [Esha Mayuri][esha] and this new format, this is now possible — [#286]
  * While we were at it, we decided that consistency was key, so we updated the
    configuration style for `--include-path-patterns` and `--exclude-path-patterns`
    to match this new style as well! Once again, thanks to [Esha Mayuri][esha]
    for making this happen — [#289]
* The `scan-folder` sub-command now has a `--recurse` / `--no-recurse` flag, so
  that you can control whether all sub-folders are scanned, or only the current
  folder. This was added by [Esha Mayuri][esha] — [#283]
* The recently added `--b64-entropy-score` and `--hex-entropy-score` options
  raised some great discussion and sparked in-depth investigation into what
  these values represented, and how they might be more usefully represented /
  handled. This led to the new `--entropy-sensitivity` option, with a range of
  0-100, for capturing values that range from totally non-random all the way up
  to only wholly random strings. The discussion, research, and option were
  tackled by [Scott Bailey][scott] — [#272]
* The `--json` and `--compact` options have been consolidated into the new
  `--output-format` / `--of` option. In addition to consolidating these two,
  this gives us a place to more easily add future output formats as we see fit.
  This work was done by [Esha Mayuri][esha] — [#266]
* The `--fetch` and `--no-fetch` options are no more! We realized that this was
  never something that `tartufo` itself should have been doing, so we have
  completely removed the functionality in this new version. Thanks go to
  [Sushant Mimani][sushant] for this work — [#244]

### Bug Fixes

* Previously, when tartufo would attempt to scan a shallow clone, such as what
  would be produced by default by the `actions/checkout` GitHub Action, it
  wouldn't actually scan anything. It would see that there were no local
  branches to be scanned, and then report success. This could have led to a
  false sense of security, such as if `tartufo` was being run as part of a
  GitHub Actions workflow. Now, when `tartufo` detects that it is being run
  against such a clone, it will instead scan the entire checkout as a single
  commit. This was fixed by [Joey Wilhelm][joey] — [#270]

### Other Contributors

Additional contributions were made by [Erik Owen][erik], [Mertay Dayanc][mertay],
and [Anatoliy Serputov][anatoliy]. Without their work, this release would not
have been possible!

## Looking to the Future

As you can see, a great deal of work has gone into this release. And these are
only the largest changes listed here! We hope that this gives you some idea
of what we've been working on, and we hope that this new release truly does
provide for a better experience for you. Please let us know in the [issues] or
[discussions] what you think, what you like, or what problems you find! Who
knows, maybe we'll be adding your name to this list of contributors for the next
major release!

## But Wait, There's More!

You didn't think that was all we had for you, did you? Of course not!

In addition to all the work that has gone into this new release for `tartufo`,
our very own [Wayne Berry][wayne] has been working on a [VSCode] extension that
will help identify high entropy strings, and get exclusions added to your
`tartufo.toml` configuration file, right from your editor!

You can check out the source code [here][ext-source], or head over to the Visual
Studio Marketplace to install it [here][ext-install]. And if you don't believe
yet how wonderful this is, check it out in action below!
