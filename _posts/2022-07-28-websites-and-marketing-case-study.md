We recently published a case study documenting how GoDaddyâ€™s Websites + Marketing service improved website performance for millions of websites.

The case study explains how we:

- used Google Lighthouse's "lab data" to identify areas for improvement in page load speed metrics.
- turned to "real visitor data" by leveraging Core Web Vitals and improved our pass rate by 75%.
