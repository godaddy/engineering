Entrepreneurs around the globe trust GoDaddy to bring their ideas to life
online. As one of the world’s largest online service providers, GoDaddy takes
seriously our role in protecting our customer's websites from malicious
cyberattacks and preventing illegal activities on our platforms. In particular,
GoDaddy takes an unsparing stance when it comes to hosting Child Sexual Abuse
Material (CSAM). **We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers
minors**. We use robust procedures and tools such as
[PhotoDNA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna) (and similar tools) to
detect, remove, and report hosted CSAM on our platform.

Below we discuss how we’ve helped to protect children – within our systems and
beyond – and how we fight this abhorrent crime.

## A Strong History of Protecting Children

For the past two decades, GoDaddy has worked diligently to help keep the
Internet a safe and enjoyable place, especially for children. GoDaddy employees,
including former Director of Global Policy Ben Butler, have served as witnesses
at congressional hearings and helped drive federal Internet-related legislation
such as the [PROTECT Our Children Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/1738).
This act was later signed into law by President Bush in 2008 and has since been
used by law enforcement to aggressively fight and prosecute online child
predators.

We’ve been a proud member of [Technology Coalition](https://technologycoalition.org/),
a collaborative effort among industry leaders to prevent and eradicate online
Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA), since its inception. We are proud to
be a part of [Thorn's](https://www.thorn.org/) Safer community. Using their APIs
we are able to expand the shared knowledge of CSEA content by contributing
hashes, scanning against industry hash database, and sending feedback on false
positives. GoDaddy is also a member of the
[Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG)](https://www.m3aawg.org/)
and has collaborated with this group to put a spotlight on CSAM in the form of
panels with industry experts and best common practices related to the
disposition of CSAM investigations and maintaining employee wellness.

## GoDaddy in Action

Through our deep involvement with the development of industry standards for
protecting children online, we created and implemented our own strategy for
removing CSAM from our platforms.

At GoDaddy, we constantly design and develop state of the art software systems
to combat CSAM. We use tools like AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Go, Python among
others to reliably detect and report hosted CSAM. These tools help us to stop
further re-victimization of children and mitigate continued exposure to
traumatic content for our content reviewers.

Using our [Abuse Reporting Form](https://extendedsupport.godaddy.com/abusereport),
GoDaddy's trusted reporters and the general public can report material found
online that promotes, encourages, or engages in child exploitation or abuse of
children. This triggers an investigation, which is depicted in the following
diagram.

GoDaddy’s Child Safety Team, part of the larger Digital Crimes Unit, is
responsible for investigating these reports. This team is comprised of a
combination of Analysts who investigate, remediate, and report instances of
abuse, and Software Engineers who are responsible for developing and maintaining
advanced technologies to combat this type of abuse. This includes technologies
that proactively monitor and alert investigators to websites that may contain
this content.

After an investigation is complete, verified reports are filed with the
[National Center of Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)](https://www.missingkids.org/)
using their [Web Service API](https://report.cybertip.org/ispws/documentation/),
and the websites are archived and preserved as evidence for government agencies.

## Human First

GoDaddy takes a human-first approach to both our customers and our employees,
with safety as our top priority. Due to the innate sensitivity and the nature of
work involved, GoDaddy provides an extensive wellness program for anti-abuse
staff to support their overall well-being and mental health. Anti-abuse staff
members have unlimited time-off plans and are encouraged to use it as needed.
All GoDaddy employees also have access to our global Employee Assistance Program
that offers employees access to virtual, confidential counseling for a wide
range of work or personal issues including anxiety and depression, grief,
relationship support, and more. Through this program, anti-abuse staff also have
access to join in monthly individual and group therapy sessions, specialized to
their role in fighting against CSAM.

All tools and software used by our anti-abuse staff are centered around employee
safety. Reported content is viewed and verified by professional GoDaddy Content
Reviewers in a controlled de-harming environment, using a cloud-based browser
for safe and secure online investigation. Legal policies and procedures sustain
this controlled environment that is important for the effective implementation
of security controls. These policies and procedures are consistent with
applicable laws, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance.

## Conclusion

Through our efforts to identify and combat instances of CSAM, GoDaddy has filed
thousands of verified reports with NCMEC.

The fight against CSAM is far from over, but we’ll continue to collaborate with
security companies, independent experts, law enforcement and other government
agencies to remove content and advance preventative technologies. We proudly
support cross-industry efforts to combat CSAM. For every takedown of CSAM, we
hope to prevent the victimization and exploitation of children, and bring
perpetrators of CSAM to justice.
