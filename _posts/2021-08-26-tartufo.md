Software development is tricky. Securely storing credentials and secrets that
your software needs access to can often be trickier. We've all done it, or at
least seen it. You need some credentials in your code to be able to access a
remote resource; let's say a database server. So where do you store that? Well
your git repository is private, so you just store it right there! Done deal!

Right?

Except... what if some nefarious individual gets their hands on your code? Now
they suddenly have access to that same database, and can wreak havoc on your
precious data. Even if your repository is private, there are any number of ways
that this can happen. Maybe a team member loses their laptop. Maybe somebody
leaks their credentials. Maybe you send a copy of your code to a vendor for them
to work on or use it.

And here's the real kicker: Even if you remove that password from your code,
because of the way that git works, it _still exists_. Anybody who has a copy of
that repository suddenly has access to that entire history and every single
credential that was ever committed to it. Clearly, that is not an ideal scenario.

Now, this blog post is not about how you _should_ be storing this sensitive data.
There are many other posts covering that topic, such as [our very own write-up]
on the GoDaddy-developed [kubernetes-external-secrets] project. Instead, this
post aims to cover what you should do when this potentially grave error has
already occurred, and even how to prevent it from happening again in the future!

## The Problem

At GoDaddy, we had to face exactly this situation: We wanted to transition our
tens of thousands of repositories to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, but had not been
historically rigorous about keeping secrets out of git. And with hundreds of
teams writing code for over two decades, this was really a bit of an
inevitability. So the question then became: How do we not only find and remove
all of that potentially sensitive information from all our pre-existing code,
but also wipe it out of the _history_ of said code, and prevent any more
sensitive data from creeping in there in the future?

## The Hunt

Once we had identified our problem, it was time for us to go on the hunt for a
solution. Some of the brightest minds in the company came together and compiled
a set of several dozen tools to be evaluated for the purpose, and a feature
matrix for what we needed. In the end, we settled on the well-known and
well-respected tool [truffleHog]. This option covered the largest swath of our
requested features, and on top of that it was open source! Bonus! This meant
that we could contribute back to this tool and to the community as we brought
this tool up to the level that we ultimately wanted it at for our purposes.

Unfortunately, as with all good stories, there was a problem. Once we settled on
this solution, we found that the development for truffleHog had stalled out a
bit. It was maintained by a single author at the time, and wasn't getting the
amount of engagement that we hoped for.

## The Solution

After much careful consideration, we decided that the best solution for us at
the time was going to be to create a hard fork of truffleHog. We would use it
and its functionality as our base, and continue to develop it into a tool to
meet all of our needs; something we could truly be proud of. At the same time,
we would keep this an open source project, to continue contributing back to the
community as we had originally intended!

And thus was born [tartufo]!

Why `tartufo`, you may be wondering? Well, we wanted a distinct new name while
paying homage to the origin of this project. So we decided that we should stick
with the theme of "truffles". And [according to Wikipedia]:

> Tartufo (/tɑːrˈtuːfoʊ/, Italian: [tarˈtuːfo]; meaning "truffle") is an Italian
> ice cream dessert originating from Pizzo, Calabria.

It was kismet! I mean, that just sounds (and looks) delicious! Why would we
_not_ want that?

## The Evolution

Now that we had settled on a path, it was time to begin building this tool into
the full-blown solution we were looking for.

The original tool, truffleHog, already contained some great, useful functionality.
It could dig through a git repository's commit history and scan every commit for
sensitive data using a combination of regular expressions and [Shannon entropy]
calculation. This meant that we could catch both obvious leaks -- things that fit
a very specific pattern -- and some things that are not so obvious. Things that
look more like just a random string of characters, like they might be a machine
generated password, key, or something of the sort.

In order for us to use this at scale for enterprise-wide use though, we needed a
bit more functionality, and we needed to work on the user friendliness a bit. In
[the words of the author], [Dylan Ayrey]:

> At the time the tool was meant to be a tool to help [Dylan] with Bug Bounties.

Being a personal-use tool, user friendliness didn't necessarily need to be
top-of-mind. But we were about to encourage several thousand engineers to start
adopting this tool across thousands of code repositories. User focus was an
absolute must for us. So we changed from a dizzying array of command line
options, often mutually exclusive, for selecting the mode of operation, to a set
of sub-commands. This gave us the invocation forms of
[tartufo scan-local-repo][tartufo-local] for scanning previously cloned git
repositories, and [tartufo scan-remote-repo][tartufo-remote], for scanning
repositories that the user did not yet have cloned locally.

We also wanted to be able to use this tool to prevent more secrets from getting
committed to our code. If it could scan after-the-fact, why not scan before and
keep us out of these situations in the first place? This led us to add on the
new sub-command [tartufo pre-commit][tartufo-precommit], and to add support for
using this in the [pre-commit] invocation framework.

Another essential feature was the ability to create a configuration file, so that
we could ensure the exact same options were used every time the tool was run. For
this, we decided to utilize the increasingly popular [TOML] format, and allowed
our users to place their configuration directly into the automatically detected
[tartufo.toml] file. Now there was no more need to remember every single option,
evern single time you were running the command! Talk about user friendliness.

Finally, we really wanted to be able to fine-tune our false positive exclusions
a little better. While truffleHog offered the ability to exclude entire files
from scanning, this didn't really work for us. We needed more fine-grained
control over these exclusions, as there may be a single MD5 hash in a comment in
a source code file, and we don't want to have to forsake scanning that entire
file just to avoid that one little false positive. Enhancement in this area has
seen a lot of work, and it is still continuing to this day. Our new [methods of
excluding] these false positives include (so far):

* [Ignoring git submodules]
* [Allowing regex-based exclusion of high entropy strings][entropy-exclusion]
* [Exclusion of match signatures][signature-exclusion]
  * For this, we generate a stable hash of every single string we find during
    the scan that is a potential issue. It is generated using the blazing fast
    [BLAKE2] hashing algorithm against the file name and matched string. This
    means that you can exclude a signature once and any time it pops up in the
    entire history of the code, it will be ignored.
* [File-based exclusion][file-exclusion]
  * This may sound very much like the exclusion feature originally found in
    truffleHog. And really, it is! But we made one enhancement to it: Previously,
    the command line flag required you to point to a file which contained all of
    your exclusion patterns. This could get to be a bit cumbersome, so we
    enhanced this to instead accept all of the exclusion patterns either on the
    command line, or directly in the configuration file!

Once we had gotten this work put into place, we realized that it was no use if
people didn't know how to use it, and specifically how to use it to get rid of
old secrets that had already been committed to their code, before moving it to
the public cloud! So to aid our users, we wrote up [a step-by-step guide]
to run our users through the process of not only finding any secrets that may
have gotten scattered through the history of their code, but also how to
eliminate them from there with the help of the powerful [BFG Repo Cleaner].

## The Result

And that brings us to where we are today. Happily scrubbing our history, and
actively working to prevent any future problems from occurring!

For a quick peek into just how this looks from a user perspective, here is a
real-world example from a commit I made to `tartufo` itself just this morning:

![tartufo pre-commit example]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tartufo/pre-commit.png)

This is the aforementioned [pre-commit] framework that we have enabled in
`tartufo`. As you can see, the `tartufo` check itself is only one of many checks
that happen automatically on every commit! This has been a huge help to our
developers in actively preventing any new secrets from getting into our code.
And as a bonus, with all of these extra checks happening at the same time, we're
speeding up a lot of our code reviews by preventing other small, common problems
from occurring.

And just for a bit of demonstration, I've uncommented some of the exclusions in
tartufo's configuration. Below is an example of what you might see as the result
of a scan of a repository with, shall we say, a "robust" history.

![tartufo compact scan example]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tartufo/scan-example.png)

You can see that each match gives you a good bit of information about each match
-- and this is in the compact output mode! Each line is showing you:

* What type of match; Regular expression, or high entropy
* What file the match occurred in
* What was the offending string
* What is the calculated signature for this match
* More detail on match (specifically for regular expressions, this will tell you
  _which_ regular expression matched)

And if you run this same scan in the default (non-compact) mode, you will get
_FAR_ more information. At times, it can be excessively verbose. But all of that
output can be useful in understanding the full context of a match in your
history.

## The Future

Going forward, we know that there is a lot more work that can and must be done
to make this tool a true beast. It is not at all without its own set of issues.
And, of course, the more users start getting into it, the more issues are found
and the more features are requested. In our efforts to continue improving, we are
now actively working on [Tartufo v3.0]! This will primarily include:

* Changing the backend library from [GitPython] to [pygit2]. This will solve one
  of our users' primary complaints: Speed. This tool is not fast. And a large
  part of that is because, behind the scenes, we're just issuing `git` commands
  in a sub-process and then reading the result. With this change, we will be able
  to directly understand the git db itself, and work directly with that, removing
  several layers of abstraction that are currently slowing us down.
* A new `scan-folder` command. If we can scan a repository, why can't we just
  scan a folder full of files? Yay for expanded modes of operation!
* Live output! Right now, tartufo holds onto all of the results and spews them
  out to the user as one big lumped together message once its finished its work.
  This will help solve the frequent user question of, "How do I know it's
  actually doing anything?"
* Updated documentation! We have lots of documentation now, but it can always be
  better. We're going to be incorporating all user feedback we've gotten so far,
  and working to make the docs as user friendly and helpful as possible.
* A GitHub Action, published to the Marketplace, so that you can run tartufo
  against every pull request and make sure those pesky secrets aren't making it
  into your code.
