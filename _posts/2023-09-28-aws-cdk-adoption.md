We recently published a case study with Amazon Web Services about how GoDaddy enables faster and more secure infrastructure provisioning for its developers by embracing AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) for cloud workloads.

To read about how AWS CDK has enabled GoDaddy engineering teams to swiftly and securely deploy common infrastructure components, as well as enhance their ability to develop powerful products more efficiently while upholding stringent security standards, check out the blog post on AWS published here: <https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/godaddy-cdk-case-study/>.
